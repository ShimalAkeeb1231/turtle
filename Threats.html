                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Fisheries Bycatch</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Bycatch, often known as incidental capture in fishing gear, is most certainly the biggest threat to sea turtles and many other species globally. In the fishing industry, almost 40% of all creatures are thrown away as trash. Sea turtles, seabirds, marine mammals, and other species are caught and dumpedâ€”usually dead. It is unknown what will happen to animals that are captured and released while still alive and damaged.</p><br>
            
                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Consequences</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Bycatch of turtles during fishing operations has serious and extensive implications. It causes turtles to die needlessly, which contributes to a population decrease and disrupts their life cycle. This has an impact on biodiversity, ecological processes, and the harmony of marine environments, in addition to threatening the existence of turtle species. The economic effects of turtle bycatch also include financial losses for fisheries and trade restrictions.</p><br>

                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Solution</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). TEDs are specially designed escape mechanisms that can be installed in fishing nets to allow captured turtles to escape while retaining the target catch. By incorporating TEDs, fishermen can reduce the accidental capture and mortality of turtles while still being able to catch their desired species.</p>

                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Consumption and illegal trade </h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Despite the fact that sea turtles are protected by legislation in the majority of nations, their survival is nevertheless seriously threatened by the illegal trade in their meat, eggs, and shells. The meat and eggs from these animals are gathered for human consumption and, in some cultures, are regarded as delicacies. The sale of turtle eggs is a significant sector that employs numerous individuals in several nations.</p><br>
            
                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Consequences</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Consuming and selling turtle flesh and eggs illegally has serious negative effects on the environment, including loss of biodiversity, ecosystem imbalance, population reduction, and legal and social repercussions. These actions endanger turtle populations' existence and disturb the sensitive ecosystems of the sea.</p><br>

                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Solution </h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Promoting sustainable livelihood options for impacted communities, fostering international collaboration, and upholding regional agreements are all ways to dissuade unlawful activities. Other ways include strengthening laws and law enforcement to prevent them, increasing awareness and educating people to change attitudes and lower demand.</p>

                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Plastic and other marine debris</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Plastic has an impact on sea turtles at every stage of development. When they are hatchlings, they crawl through plastic to get to the ocean; when they migrate, they swim through it; when they do, they mistake it for jellyfish, one of their favorite diets; and when they are adults, they crawl back through it. Each year, ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris cause the deaths of thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals, as well as more than 1 million seabirds.</p><br>
            
                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Consequences</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Tiny pieces of plastic eaten by fish or other animals can have a cascade impact since those creatures may end up as prey for turtles and other animals. Due to their inability to discern between plastic and natural food, turtles may consume plastic objects like bags, which can lodge in their stomachs and pose major health hazards. This demonstrates the interconnection of plastic waste and its effects on marine life, especially turtles.</p><br>

                <h2 class="p-title">&nbsp;Solution</h2><br>
                <p class="p-description">Enhance waste management systems and reduce plastic waste. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to encourage the use of reusable alternatives to single-use plastics, put in place efficient waste collection and recycling systems, increase public awareness of the effects of plastic pollution on marine life, and foster cooperation between governments and organizations in order to enforce laws and regulations. By doing these things, we can reduce the amount of plastic that turtles consume and safeguard their wellbeing.</p>
