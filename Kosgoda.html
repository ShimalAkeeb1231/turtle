                            <p class="intro">Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now at risk of extinction. All five of the country's species can be found making their nests at Kosgoda, one of the relatively few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill, Leatherback, Green, and Olive Ridley turtles. On your trip, you could get to enjoy the satisfying pleasure of releasing some of these precious creatures into the water! The first two or three times the wave hits the helpless souls, they start fluttering back. However, as they fly inside their houses, the ocean fills your heart with such joy.</p>

                                This turtle hatchery is located in Kosgoda, 8 minutes away (3.8 km) from Ahungalle. The project was initiated in 1981, by Dudley Perera, and it is run by the Perera family. Dudley is educated in the conservation of sea animals, is very passionate and enthusiastic about his project. He loves to share his knowledge with both locals and tourists.
                                This hatchery strives to make great attempts to preserve and protect turtles by helping to enhance the process of hatching and ensuring safe survival of baby turtles after hatching. They also provide care and treatment of injured or sick adult turtles and then releasing them back into the seas. They also conduct workshops and programs creating awareness among foreign visitors and locals.
